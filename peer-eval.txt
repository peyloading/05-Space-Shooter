What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

Arcade has sound functionality! 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

 The usage of sound was really impressive to me and I'd like to look into it for future assignments. 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

Consider implementing movement to the ships or maybe sound effects for the bullets. 

What could have been clearer or better commented?

How the music program runs. 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 Everything is where it needs to be for the game to work, but I was confused about why the ships are placed so oddly. 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yup.

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

You could go a little more into your thought process about why you chose the music/colors you did, but other than that it's great!

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

The music was super a e s t h e t ic and made me happy to play your game. Plus the pinks you chose were really rad.
